Description: Fits a multidimensional scaling (MDS) model for three-way data. It integrates concepts from structural equation models by assuming an underlying, latent dissimilarity matrix. It uses an alternating estimation procedure in which the unknown symmetric dissimilarity matrix is estimated in a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework while the objects are represented in a low-dimensional space. As a special case it can also handle asymmetric input dissimilarities.
