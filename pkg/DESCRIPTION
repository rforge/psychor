Description: This package performs a homogeneity analysis, aka a multiple correspondence
  analysis, but with many additional options. Variables can be grouped into
  sets, in order to emulate regression analysis and canonical analysis. For
  each variable there are, in addition, rank constraints on the category
  quantifications (or transformations) and level constraints (which allows
  one to treat a variable as nominal, ordinal, or numerical).
