Description: Contains two main functions: one for
        solving general isotone regression problems using the
        pool-adjacent-violators algorithm (PAVA); another one provides
        a framework for active set methods for isotone optimization
        problems with arbitrary order restrictions. Various types of
        loss functions are prespecified.
