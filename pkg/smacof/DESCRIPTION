Description: Provides the following approaches of multidimensional
    scaling (MDS) based on stress minimization by means of majorization
    (smacof): simple smacof (basic MDS) on symmetric dissimilarity matrices,
    smacof for rectangular matrices (unfolding models), smacof with constraints
    on the configuration, three-way smacof for individual differences
    (including constraints for idioscal, indscal, and identity), and spherical
    smacof (primal and dual algorithm). The MDS type can be ratio, interval, ordinal,
    (including primary, secondary, and tertiary approaches for tie handling), and msplines. 
    Jackknife and permutation tests are provided.
